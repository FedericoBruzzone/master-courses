Exercise 4: Test Driven Development of Prime Factors.
Prime Factors. There are two kinds of positive numbers: prime numbers and composite numbers. A composite number is the product of a sequence of prime numbers. You can write a simple generator, named prime_factors to factor numbers and yield each prime factor of the number; the generators take as an input the number to factor and returns the prime factors from the smallest to the largest. Note that, a simple-looking for -loop shall not work; the prime factor of 128 is 2, repeated 7 times. Note also that 1 is not a factor or better is always a factor so can be excluded by the list.

The generator have to be developed by using the test-driven techniques; a commitment without test cases will be considered completely wrong.
