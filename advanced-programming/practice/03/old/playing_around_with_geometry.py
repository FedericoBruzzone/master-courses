'''
To implement the classes representing: equilateral triangles, circles, rectangles, squares and pentagons 
with the following characteristics/properties/capabilities.

1. they should understand the calculate_area() and calculate_perimeter() messages with the obvious meaning
2. the state must be private
3. a list of geometric shapes must be sortable by area and by perimeter (not at the same time, of course)
4. to add an hexagon class should maintain all the capabilities of the existing classes and correctly 
interact with them
5. to write a iterator that permits to return the elements of a list of geometric shapes sorted by 
increasing areas
