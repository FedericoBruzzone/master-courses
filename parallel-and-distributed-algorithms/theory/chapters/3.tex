\subsection{Types of parallel architecture}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \textbf{shared memory}:\\ 
  - Invisible property:\\
   We have a central clock\\
  - Communication property:\\
   Constant time communication between processors:\\
   For example: \textit{If $P_j$ wants communicate $x$ to $P_i$:}\\
   - $P_j$ writes $x$ in central memory\\
   - $P_i$ read $x$ from central memory
 \item \textbf{distributed memory}:
  - Invisible property:\\
   We have a central clock\\
  - Communication property:\\
   The communication depends on the distance between processors: if $P_j$ wants communicate with $P_i$, we should ask ourselves how many processors there are in between.
\end{enumerate}
